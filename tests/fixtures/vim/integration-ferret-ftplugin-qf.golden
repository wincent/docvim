Controls whether to set up setting overrides for quickfix windows. These are
various settings, such as norelativenumber, nolist and nowrap, that are
intended to make the quickfix window, which is typically very small relative
to other windows, more usable.

A full list of overridden settings can be found in ferret-overrides.

To prevent the custom settings from being applied, set g:FerretQFOptions to
0:

    let g:FerretQFOptions=0

- `d`{motion} (Normal-mode): delete range indicated by {motion}

To prevent these mappings from being set up, set to 0:
