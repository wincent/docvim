*foo.txt*    We need this because otherwise we don't get link targets      *foo*

A HEADING                                                        *foo-a-heading*

A subheading ~

AN OVERLENGTH HEADING WHEN I REALLY SHOULD HAVE CHOSE SOMETHING SHORTER *foo-an-overlength-heading-when-i-really-should-have-chose-something-shorter*

Note that in order for that last one to be shown as a heading in Vim, we
can't allow the usual hard-wrapping rules to apply.
