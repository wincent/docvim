## Intro

Scalpel provides a streamlined shortcut for replacing all instances of the word currently under the cursor throughout a file.

In normal mode pressing `<Leader>e` (mnemonic: "edit") will display a prompt pre-populated with the current word and with the cursor placed so that you can start typing the desired replacement:

```
:Scalpel/\v<foo>//
```

Press `<Enter>` and Scalpel will prompt to confirm each substitution, starting at the current word (unlike a normal `:%s` command, which starts at the top of the file).

Scalpel works similarly in visual mode, except that it scopes itself to the current visual selection rather than operating over the entire file.

Note that `:Scalpel` just calls through to an underlying `scalpel#substitute` function that does the real work, ultimately calling Vim's own `:substitute`. As such, be aware that whatever changes you make to the command-line prior to pressing `<Enter>` must keep it a valid pattern, or bad things will happen.

The mapping can be suppressed by setting:

```
let g:ScalpelMap=0
```

Or overridden:

```
" Use <Leader>s instead of default <Leader>e:
nmap <Leader>s <Plug>(Scalpel)
```

In any case, Scalpel won't overwrite any pre-existing mapping that you might have defined for `<Leader>e`, nor will it create an unnecessary redundant mapping if you've already mapped something to `<Plug>(Scalpel)`.

The `:Scalpel` command name can be overridden if desired. For example, you could shorten it to `:S` with:

```
let g:ScalpelCommand='S'
```

Then your Scalpel prompt would look like:

```
:S/\v<foo>//
```

The command can be entirely suppressed by setting `g:ScalpelCommand` to an empty string:

```
let g:ScalpelCommand=''
```

Finally, all plug-in functionality can be deactivated by setting:

```
let g:ScalpelLoaded=1
```

in your `~/.vimrc`.

## Installation

To install Scalpel, use your plug-in management system of choice.

If you don't have a "plug-in management system of choice" and your version of Vim has `packages` support (ie. `+packages` appears in the output of `:version`) then you can simply place the plugin at a location under your `'packpath'` (eg. `~/.vim/pack/bundle/start/scalpel` or similar).

For older versions of Vim, I recommend [Pathogen](https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) due to its simplicity and robustness. Assuming that you have Pathogen installed and configured, and that you want to install Scalpel into `~/.vim/bundle`, you can do so with:

```
git clone https://github.com/wincent/scalpel.git ~/.vim/bundle/scalpel
```

Alternatively, if you use a Git submodule for each Vim plug-in, you could do the following after `cd`-ing into the top-level of your Git superproject:

```
git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/scalpel.git ~/vim/bundle/scalpel
git submodule init
```

To generate help tags under Pathogen, you can do so from inside Vim with:

```
:call pathogen#helptags()
```

```

- Publish the code:

```
git push origin master --follow-tags
git push github master --follow-tags
```

- Produce the release archive:

```
git archive -o scalpel-$VERSION.zip HEAD -- .
```
