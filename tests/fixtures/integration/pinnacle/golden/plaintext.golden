Pinnacle provides functions for manipulating |:highlight| groups.

INSTALLATION                                             *pinnacle-installation*

To install Pinnacle, use your plug-in management system of choice.

If you don't have a "plug-in management system of choice", I recommend
Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) due to its simplicity and
robustness. Assuming that you have Pathogen installed and configured, and
that you want to install vim-docvim into `~/.vim/bundle`, you can do so with:
>
    git clone https://github.com/wincent/pinnacle.git ~/.vim/bundle/pinnacle
<
Alternatively, if you use a Git submodule for each Vim plug-in, you could do
the following after `cd`-ing into the top-level of your Git superproject:
>
    git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/pinnacle.git ~/vim/bundle/pinnacle
    git submodule init
<
To generate help tags under Pathogen, you can do so from inside Vim with:
>
    :call pathogen#helptags()
<
