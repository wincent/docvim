INTRO                                                              *loupe-intro*

    "loupe (noun)
    a small magnifying glass used by jewelers and watchmakers."


                                                                *loupe-features*
Loupe enhances Vim's |search-commands| in four ways:

1. Makes the currently selected match easier to see ~

When searching using |/|, |?|, |star|, |#|, |n|, |N| or similar, it can be hard to see
the "current" match from among all the matches that 'hlsearch' highlights.
Loupe makes the currently selected match easier to see by:

- Applying a different |:highlight| group (by default, |hl-IncSearch|) to the
  match under the cursor.
- Keeping the matching line centered within the window when jumping between
  matches with |n| and |N|.

2. Applies sane pattern syntax by default ~

Loupe makes "very magic" (|/\v|) syntax apply by default when searching. This
is true even if you initiate a search via a novel means, such as from a
visual selection or with a complicated |:range| prefix.

This means that you can use a pattern syntax closer to the familiar regular
expression syntax from languages such as Perl, Ruby, JavaScript (indeed,
most other modern languages that support regular expressions).

3. Provides a shortcut to remove search highlighting ~

Loupe maps <leader>n to quickly remove all 'hlsearch' highlighting (although
you can provide an alternative mapping of your choosing or suppress the
feature entirely).

4. Sensible defaults for search-related features ~

Loupe provides reasonable defaults for most search-related Vim settings to
provide a good "out of the box" experience. For more details, or to see how
to override Loupe's settings, see |loupe-overrides|.

INSTALLATION                                                *loupe-installation*

To install Loupe, use your plug-in management system of choice.

If you don't have a "plug-in management system of choice", I recommend
Pathogen (https://github.com/tpope/vim-pathogen) due to its simplicity and
robustness. Assuming that you have Pathogen installed and configured, and
that you want to install Loupe into `~/.vim/bundle`, you can do so with:
>
    git clone https://github.com/wincent/loupe.git ~/.vim/bundle/loupe
<
Alternatively, if you use a Git submodule for each Vim plug-in, you could do
the following after `cd`-ing into the top-level of your Git superproject:
>
    git submodule add https://github.com/wincent/loupe.git ~/vim/bundle/loupe
    git submodule init
<
To generate help tags under Pathogen, you can do so from inside Vim with:
>
    :call pathogen#helptags()
<
OVERRIDES                                                      *loupe-overrides*

Loupe sets a number of search-related Vim settings to reasonable defaults in
order to provide a good "out of the box" experience:


                                                        *loupe-history-override*
'history'

Increased to 1000, to increase the number of previous searches remembered.
Note that Loupe only applies this setting if the current value of 'history'
is less than 1000.


                                                       *loupe-hlsearch-override*
'hlsearch'

Turned on (when there is a previous search pattern, highlight all its
matches).


                                                      *loupe-incsearch-override*
'incsearch'

Turned on (while typing a search command, show where the pattern matches, as
it was typed so far).


                                                     *loupe-ignorecase-override*
'ignorecase'

Turned on (to ignore case in search patterns).


                                                      *loupe-shortmess-override*
'shortmess'

Adds "s", which suppresses the display of "search hit BOTTOM, continuing at
TOP" and "search hit TOP, continuing at BOTTOM" messages.


                                                      *loupe-smartcase-override*
'smartcase'

Turned on (overrides 'ignorecase', making the search pattern case-sensitive
whenever it containers uppercase characters).

To override any of these choices, you can place overrides in an
|after-directory| (ie. `~/.vim/after/plugin/loupe.vim`). For example:
>
     " Override Loupe's 'history' setting from 1000 to 10000.
     set history=10000

     " Reset Loupe's 'incsearch' back to Vim default.
     set incsearch&vim

     " Remove unwanted 's' from 'shortmess'.
     set shortmess-=s
<

Just as Loupe aims to improve the within-file search experience, Ferret does
the same for multi-file searching and replacing:

AUTHORS                                                          *loupe-authors*

Loupe is written and maintained by Greg Hurrell <greg@hurrell.net>.

The original idea for the |g:LoupeHighlightGroup| feature was taken from
Damian Conway's Vim set-up:

-

  https://github.com/thoughtstream/Damian-Conway-s-Vim-Setup/blob/master/plugin/hlnext.vim

Which he discussed in his "More Instantly Better Vim" presentation at OSCON
2013:

HISTORY                                                          *loupe-history*

1.0 (28 December 2015) ~

- Renamed the |<Plug>LoupeClearHighlight| mapping to
  |<Plug>(LoupeClearHighlight)|.

0.1 (5 July 2015) ~

- Initial release, extracted from my dotfiles
  (https://github.com/wincent/wincent).

MAPPINGS                                                        *loupe-mappings*


                                                   *<Plug>(LoupeClearHighlight)*
Loupe maps <leader>n to |<Plug>(LoupeClearHighlight)|, which clears all
visible highlights (like |:nohighlight| does). To use an alternative mapping
instead, create a different one in your |.vimrc| instead using |:nmap|:
>
    " Instead of <leader>n, use <leader>x.
    nmap <leader>x <Plug>(LoupeClearHighlight)
<
Note that Loupe will not try to set up its <leader>n mapping if any of the
following are true:

- A mapping for <leader>n already exists.
- An alternative mapping for |<Plug>(LoupeClearHighlight)| has already been
  set up from a |.vimrc|.
- The mapping has been suppressed by setting |g:LoupeClearHighlightMap| to 1
  in your |.vimrc|.

OPTIONS                                                          *loupe-options*


                                                         *g:LoupeHighlightGroup*
|g:LoupeHighlightGroup|                              string (default: IncSearch)

Specifies the |:highlight| group used to emphasize the match currently under
the cursor for the current search pattern. Defaults to "IncSearch" (ie.
|hl-IncSearch|). For example:
>
    let g:LoupeHighlightGroup='Error'
<
To prevent any special highlighting from being applied, set this option to
"" (ie. the empty string).


                                                                 *g:LoupeLoaded*
|g:LoupeLoaded|                                              any (default: none)

To prevent Loupe from being loaded, set |g:LoupeLoaded| to any value in your
|.vimrc|. For example:
>
    let g:LoupeLoaded=1
<

                                                      *g:LoupeClearHighlightMap*
|g:LoupeClearHighlightMap|                                  boolean (default: 1)

Controls whether to set up the |<Plug>(LoupeClearHighlight)| mapping. To
prevent any mapping from being configured, set to 0:
>
    let g:LoupeClearHighlightMap=0
<

                                                              *g:LoupeVeryMagic*
|g:LoupeVeryMagic|                                          boolean (default: 1)

Controls whether "very magic" pattern syntax (|/\v|) is applied by default. To
disable, set to 0:
>
    let g:LoupeVeryMagic=0
<

                                                          *g:LoupeCenterResults*
|g:LoupeCenterResults|                                      boolean (default: 1)

Controls whether the match's line is vertically centered within the window
when jumping (via |n|, |N| etc). To disable, set to 0:
>
    let g:LoupeCenterResults=0
<
