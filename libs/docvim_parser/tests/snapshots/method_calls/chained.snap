-- Fun fact: an initial version of this was written as:
--
--    local x = y:z():then():this(true)
--
-- We correctly rejecet that with UnexpectedToken (Keyword(Then)), in agreement
-- with luajit:
--
--    '<name>' expected near 'then'
--
-- Which is slightly surprising to me as I would have expected keywords to be
-- allowed in certain positions where they wouldn't be ambiguous.

y:z():followed_by():this(true)
