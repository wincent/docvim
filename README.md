# docvim: a documentation generator for Vim plug-ins

**NOTE:** This was an early prototype of docvim, written in JavaScript. Before completing it, I decided to reimplement it in Haskell as a vehicle for learning that language more deeply. See [the master branch](https://github.com/wincent/docvim/tree/master) for the latest development.
